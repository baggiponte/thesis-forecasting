* [`01-introduction.ipynb`](https://github.com/baggiponte/thesis-forecasting/tree/main/notebooks/01-introduction.ipynb) explains the goal of the project and the motivations.
* [`02-bikesharing_and_bikemi.ipynb`](https://github.com/baggiponte/thesis-forecasting/tree/main/notebooks/02-bikesharing_and_bikemi.ipynb) is a review of the bike-sharing literature in general and the previous work done on BikeMi.
* [`03-data_ingestion_and_spatial_operations.ipynb`](https://github.com/baggiponte/thesis-forecasting/tree/main/notebooks/03-data_ingestion_and_spatial_operations.ipynb) goes through data management and spatial operations with GeoPandas to reduce the number of stalls from 280 to 200.
* [`04-stations_kmeans.ipynb`](https://github.com/baggiponte/thesis-forecasting/tree/main/notebooks/04-stations_kmeans.ipynb) the *k*-Means algorithm is applied to spatially cluster the over 200 stations.
* [`05-time_series_analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/baggiponte/thesis-forecasting/tree/main/notebooks/05-time_series_analysis.ipynb) final aggregations are performed, then decomposition (classic and STL), autocorrelation plots and order of differencing are analysed.
* [`README.md`](https://github.com/baggiponte/thesis-forecasting/tree/main/notebooks/README.md) is this file.

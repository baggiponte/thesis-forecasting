# Neural Forecasting

This is the repository for my graduate thesis on neural forecasting, i.e. the application of deep learning to time series forecasting.

## Structure of the repo

```bash
.

├── references

│   ├── reference_books
│   └── reference_tesi
├── research_journal
├── tesi_python

```

* `data` contains some of the data I am still gathering. `test_and_backup_data` contains a tarball with the `.csv` bike-sharing files. `arpa` is cumbersome, data about bike stations needs to be added.
* `refereces` has three types of reference files: `books` about time series, deep learning and other; `tesi` about other dissertations to model my thesis after and `articles` for the proper bibliography.
* `research_journal` has my research log.
* the other two folders have code in `python` and `R` respectively.

# To Do List

* define research question and structure of the paper.

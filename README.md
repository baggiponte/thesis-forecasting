# Neural Forecasting

This is the repository for my graduate thesis on neural forecasting, i.e. the application of deep learning to time series forecasting.

## Structure of the repo

```bash
.
├── README.md
├── code_python
├── research_journal
└── scripts
```

* `code_python` contains the notebooks with the analysis.
* `research_journal` has some of my considerations I wrote down. Actually, most of my errands are stored in a local knowledge tree with [logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq).
* `scripts` contains the custom shell scripts I have written to process the data.


# To Do List

Still a great deal of stuff...

* terminate the scripts to extract the data from the zip archives.

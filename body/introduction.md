## The Open Source Stack

This project would not have been possible without the oustanding and

widely adopted and competitive, sometimes even better than the proprietary software.
This project stack is 100% open source: from PostgreSQL to store the data into a local database to the Python programming language, moving through the JupyterLab integrated development environment (IDE) and the reference manager Zotero. The whole corpus of the thesis was written using markdown, an exteremly popular markup language that does nnot require a word processor. Basically, the thesis is a stack of markdown files (.md) and Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) files, and are converted into a .pdf file using $$\latex$$'s pdf engine pdflatex and the outstanding Jupyter Book project. git and GitHub were used as version control system.
